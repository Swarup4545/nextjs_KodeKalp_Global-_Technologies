## Next.js Login & Signup System with Resume Creator

Project Overview
This project is a Login and Signup system using Next.js and MongoDB, with email confirmation via SMTP server integration. Once a user signs up, they can access a simple resume creator to generate a resume by filling in their personal information such as name, education, experience, skills, and contact details.
The system uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for session management, bcrypt for password hashing, and NodeMailer to send email confirmations. The project is hosted on Vercel.
